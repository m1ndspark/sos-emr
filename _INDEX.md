# SOS EMR Code Archive - Master Index

Last updated: June 27, 2026
Source of truth: the live Zoho Creator app. This archive mirrors it.
Sync method: manual. When a workflow is verified working in Creator, paste the
exact Deluge into its .dg file and update the EXTRACTION and VERIFIED columns.

Rule: .dg files hold pure Deluge only, no comment headers, so they round-trip
cleanly back into Creator. All status and metadata live here, not in code files.

Session 4 status legend (Partner Cluster ID work, 2026-06-27):
  PROVEN   = ran clean live in this Creator instance
  BUILT    = compiles, live test pending
  ADDITIVE = built, NOT wired into a live trigger yet
  PENDING  = do not make live yet (gated on a prior step)
Extraction note: the Session 4 entries below were extracted 2026-06-27 from the
live Creator build (Session 4 export). The per-docs status (PROVEN / BUILT /
ADDITIVE / PENDING) reflects live-test state, not extraction state.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
EXTRACTION CHECKLIST
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Status per docs = what the May 8, 2026 session log claims.
Extraction = whether the live Deluge has been pulled into this archive yet.
Verified-in-Creator = confirmed the archived copy matches what is live.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
NOTES AND OPEN CONTRADICTIONS (resolve while extracting)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Full detail in context/04_open_contradictions.md. Summary:

NOTE 1  Form name unresolved. Encounter_PatientVisit (May 8 log, June module) vs
        Encounters_Main (April 30 task master). Live Creator name is ground truth.
        Confirm on first extraction and rename this folder to match.

NOTE 2  Non-Deluge logic. Some show/hide is a condition expression, not Deluge.
        Record those as short notes in the form folder so they are not lost.

NOTE 3  Known drift. May 8 log flagged Scripts 001-006 as updated in the old
        archive but NOT pushed to Creator. Extract what is actually live; note any
        archive-only version separately. Do not assume they match.

NOTE 4  Object ID format. SUPERSEDED by Session 4 (2026-06-27); see NOTE 8 for the
        canonical architecture. Branch stays DECOUPLED from referral identity:
        Referral_ID = REF-seq only, no branch token, no PHI. Session 4 settled the
        partner/location formats as PAR-<Partner_Code>-seq and
        LOC-<Partner_Code><Partner_Location_Code>-seq (Partner_Code read across
        Partner_Link). The v1.2 suffix and T011 formats are dead. The REF retrofit is
        COMPLETE (2026-06-27): REF_ID_Generator On Success now calls mint_referral_id;
        the old inline generator is superseded. Read context/07 and NOTE 8 before any
        ID or sequence work.

NOTE 8  Partner Cluster ID architecture (Session 4, 2026-06-27). One standalone mint
        function per ID type is the single source of truth for that ID's format. Each
        mint is called by BOTH the form On Success generator (a one-liner) AND a
        backfill sweep, so API/import paths that bypass form workflows are still
        covered. Idempotency guard: act only when the ID is blank or "<PREFIX>-REVIEW-";
        never overwrite a valid ID. Form validations (cancel submit) hard-block at the
        form; the REVIEW- mint branch is the backstop for non-form creation paths.
        ID formats: REF-seq | PAR-<Partner_Code>-seq |
        LOC-<Partner_Code><Partner_Location_Code>-seq.
        Field settings applied: No-duplicate-values on Partner_ID, Partner_Location_ID,
        Partner_Code (Referral_ID already had it). Sequence_Tracker rows REF, PAR, LOC
        seeded at 1001.
        DONE 2026-06-27: auto-demote primary (Primary_Office_Auto_Demote, replaces the
        one-per-partner validation, now DISABLED); Partner_Link lock validation; stamp
        generators live-tested (Partner_Rate, Partner_Billing_Contact); REF retrofit live.
        OPEN / next session:
        - Report: add Partner Code column to Partner_Locations Report, group by partner
        - Run backfill sweeps (LOC, PAR, REF); confirm idempotent, fills only blanks
        - Partner_Link lock: add UI read-only on edit as a second layer (validation done)
        - GUARDRAIL: deleting a Partner ORPHANS its locations (dangling Partner_Link ->
          backfill flags LOC-REVIEW). Block deleting a Partner that still has
          Partner_Locations, or force deactivate instead. Found 2026-06-27 in backfill test.
        - Patient_Full_Name_Generator: confirm the 4 link names, then enable (drop .PENDING).

NOTE 9  NEXT MODULE: Assignments -> PVS (spec, not built; Session 4 2026-06-27).
        Assignment = one Employee assigned a Referral. Form fields: Referral_Link
        (-> Referrals_Main), Employee_Link (-> Employees), Assignment_Status
        (Pending/Acknowledged), Acknowledged_On. On Success: sendmail to
        Employee_Link.Employee_Email (CONFIRM exact email link name). Acknowledge =
        provider flips status. Referral_Link lookup DISPLAY: Patient_Full_Name +
        Referral_Date + Referral_ID (sort newest-first); search by name OR referral id;
        filter to unassigned/open referrals. DECISION 2026-06-27: add a dedicated
        Referral_Date field to Referrals_Main (distinct from native Added Time). This is
        why Patient_Full_Name_Generator exists (feeds the lookup display).

NOTE 5  Secrets and data. Never commit keys, tokens, secrets, test records, or
        PHI. Code only.

NOTE 6  Referrals_Main has 5 On-User-Input formatters live (Decision_Maker_Phone,
        Patient_Phone, Patient_SSN, Facility_Phone, Partner_POC_Phone), not the 2
        previously tracked. Each appears under both a "Created" trigger group and a
        "Created or Edited" group; the "Created or Edited" copies are the enabled
        canonical set (extract those). Decision Maker Phone Format is enabled under
        BOTH groups, but the contains("(") idempotency guard makes a double-fire
        harmless. The 4 phone formatters share one pattern: guard on "(", strip to
        digits, take the last 10, reformat to (AAA) MMM-LLLL.

NOTE 7  Referrals_Main is NOT entered by humans in Creator. The public form is a
        Zoho Form mapped into this Creator form; the Creator form only stores data
        for backend processing. Implications for the 5 formatters:
        - SSN Format is load-bearing: Zoho Forms cannot format SSN, and the reporting
          dashboard needs XXX-XX-XXXX, so Creator is the only place SSN gets
          normalized. Keep it. Pattern is format-on-write (normalize once at save).
        - The 4 phone formatters are a backstop: Zoho Forms can format phone on its
          front end, so inbound phone may already be formatted (the contains("(")
          guard then no-ops). Kept as insurance for any non-Zoho-Form entry path
          (manual, import, API). Low stakes to disable if trimming.
        - OPEN: trigger type unconfirmed. The .dg filenames say OnUserInput, but the
          live workflow list grouped these under "Created" / "Created or Edited",
          which would fire on the Zoho Form integration (On User Input would NOT,
          since no one types in the Creator form). If confirmed On Create / On Create
          or Edit, rename files to OnCreateOrEdit__*. VERIFY by opening one real
          inbound record and checking whether the SSN/phone value is formatted or raw.
